          You can easily spot cacti and succulents thanks to their unique
          features like plump leaves or stems designed to store water. These
          incredible plants come in a wide array of shapes, colors, and forms
          that will leave you awe-struck. From spiky varieties to smooth or
          fuzzy ones, and from softly rounded to boldly angular and sculptural
          forms, there's something for everyone's taste.

          Cacti and succulents typically thrive in environments with low
          moisture, dry air, excellent drainage, and warm temperatures. However,
          it's worth noting that certain varieties can still flourish in
          partially shaded areas with a bit of humidity.
        </p>
        <p class="light-info">
          Colder temperatures increase the risk of rot, so it's important to
          protect them during chilly spells. Most of these resilient plants are
          sun-lovers and prefer abundant sunlight near windows, so it's best to
          provide them with ample natural light to keep them happy and healthy.

        <h2>Watering & Feeding</h2>
        <p>
          Let's debunk a common misconception about cacti and succulents: while
          they possess remarkable water-storing abilities in their leaves and
          stems, it's incorrect to assume that they only need minimal water.
          These resilient plants won't thrive on scarcity alone. Adequate
          watering plays a crucial role in their growth and well-being. However,
          finding the right balance is key. Overwatering will impede their
          growth, while underwatering leads to shriveling. Here are some
          guidelines to keep in mind throughout the seasons:

      <h3>Spring & Summer</h3>
      <p>
        During the active growing season, it's recommended to water your plants
        at least once a week. When watering, ensure that the soil receives a
        thorough soaking, allowing any excess water to drain away. Allow the
        potting mix to slightly dry out between waterings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, feeding your plants once a month promotes healthy growth,
        enhances disease tolerance, and encourages beautiful flowering. Autumn

      <h3>Autumn & Winter</h3>
      <p>
        This is the period when your plants enter a rest phase. Reduce watering,
        allowing the potting mix to dry out between waterings. The frequency of
        watering depends on the specific environment and the type of succulent
        you have. Winter-flowering cacti may require regular watering while
        being kept in warm conditions, whereas desert-dwelling varieties can be
        left without water during this time. You do not need to feed cacti or
        succulents during the rest period.
